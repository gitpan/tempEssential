Class::DBI::TempEssential
=========================

The Class::DBI::TempEssential module is a add-on module to Class::DBI. 
Class::DBI does lazy fetching on database-table, which means, only
columns defined in a 'Essential' group are fetch when a row is loaded, and
other columns are fetched on demand. While this is in general efficient, it
can introduce a large overhead when too many columns are choosen as essential,
or it can be time-consuming when needing too many round-trips to the database.

This module helps changing the Essential group in a dynamic, fine-grained
and localized way, making sure that other code still sees its expected 
Essential column.
